Install and configure zabbix_server on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.zabbix_server
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.container_docs
    - role: robertdebock.zabbix_repository
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for zabbix_server

# The details to connect to the database.
zabbix_server_database_host: localhost
zabbix_server_database_user: zabbix
zabbix_server_database_password: zabbix
```

------------

- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.

```yaml
---

```

A single star means the build may fail, it's marked as an experimental build.

Not all distributions work, because Zabbix has [limited OS support](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.4/manual/installation/requirements).
