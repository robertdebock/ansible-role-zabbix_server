## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.zabbix_server
```

The machine may need to be prepared using `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.selinux
    - role: robertdebock.container_docs
    - role: robertdebock.mysql
      mysql_databases:
        - name: zabbix
          encoding: utf8
          collation: utf8_bin
      mysql_users:
        - name: zabbix
          password: zabbix
          priv: "zabbix.*:ALL"
    - role: robertdebock.zabbix_repository
```

For verification `molecule/resources/verify.yml` runs after the role has been applied.
```yaml
---
- name: Verify
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: check if connection still works
      ping:
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for zabbix_server

# The details to connect to the database.
zabbix_server_database_name: zabbix
zabbix_server_database_user: zabbix
zabbix_server_database_password: zabbix

# How to connect to the mysql database, either `socket` or `network`.
zabbix_server_mysql_connection: socket

# When `zabbix_server_mysql_connection` is set to `network` this role needs
# these three extra setting.
# zabbix_server_database_host: localhost
```

## [Requirements](#requirements)

- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.
- A recent version of Ansible. (Tests run on the current, previous and next release of Ansible.)

The following roles can be installed to ensure all requirements are met, using `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`:

```yaml
---
- robertdebock.bootstrap
- robertdebock.container_docs
- robertdebock.mysql
- robertdebock.selinux
- robertdebock.zabbix_repository

```

## [Testing](#testing)

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-zabbix_server) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-zabbix_server/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
