zabbix_server
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-zabbix_server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-zabbix_server)

Install and configure zabbix_server on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.zabbix_server
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared. Tests have been done on machines prepared by this playbook:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.zabbix_repository
```
